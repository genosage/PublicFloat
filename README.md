# PublicFloat

## Description
PublicFloat is an iOS application made for the Ian Potter Museum of Art. It can show the exhibitions of the museum and allow visitors to share their feelings and thoughts about a certain exhibit with other users and also to social media such as Facebook and Twitter. There is a location tracking system to allow the system to easily find where the visitors are in the museum and the exhibit they are currently looking at. There is also a supportive administration website for the iOS application to allow the museum staff to manage the contents of the app that the visitors use.
